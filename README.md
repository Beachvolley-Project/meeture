MEETURE
It is not always easy to find people who want to play beach volleyball at the day, time and place that is convenient for you. This is why we created Meeture, the app that gathers beach volleyball fans.
After creating an account either directly through the website or connecting through Gmail account, you can either create a match or join in one of those that are already created. On Meeture, you can create an event, pick the date and time slot, define maximum the number of participants up to 10 and select one of the seven beach volleyball courts in Berlin and display their locations on the map. Other than creating the event, you can also join a created event by simply clicking on join button. Once the event is created, the user can update and delete the event.
The map shows the location that you are under the green flag and it is easy to locate the seven beach volleyball courts that are displayed under the red flags.
In order not to forget the event date, Meeture users can join the Telegram group and receive a notification whenever an event is created.
Now every Berliner is ready to enjoy the summer!
